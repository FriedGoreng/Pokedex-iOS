## Pokedex App
Pretty much what the title says. 

This Application uses Tuist in order to generate the Xcode project. After being mentally scarred from Xcode's dependency management tool, I had adopted tuist. 

There are two local libraries (once fully fleshed out) will be moved into their own separate repoisitories instaed of having a local directory within the repositoriy.
